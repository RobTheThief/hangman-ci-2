    <p>The game is played by guessing what word the game has chosen. Once the word has
        been chosen, begin guessing which letters are in the word by entering a letter
        in the text input and hitting enter or clicking "Check Letter".
    </p>
    <p>For example, you might begin by checking, is there an "e" in the word.
        Generally, start by guessing common letters like vowels, or "s," "t," and "n."
    </p>
    <p>Each wrong guess means a piece of the gallows or stickman is drawn. Once the the
        stickman has their eyes and mouth the game is over. You can also use the "Hint"
        button to get a hint, but you will loose 2 turns if you do!
    </p>
    <p>Tip: If you enter letters already revealed at the start you might get more of
        the same letters and if you don't, you won't loose a turn ðŸ¤«
